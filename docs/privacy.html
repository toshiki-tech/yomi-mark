    <p>Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>YomiMark ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
        our practices regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>YomiMark does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data.</strong> All processing of Japanese text
        (morphological analysis and furigana injection) is performed entirely on your local machine within the browser's
        context.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Since no data is collected, no data is used, shared, or sold to third parties. We do not use any external APIs or
        servers to process the text you select.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The extension uses the following permissions solely for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Used only to interact with the text selection on the page you are currently
            viewing.</li>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used only to save your enable/disable status locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page.</p>
